// String is another type of data type in JavaScript
/* 
// Strings are texts that are wrapped either in single('') or double quotes("")
// When you add two strings together you will do an operation called concatenation as we learned in the previous chapter
*/

// let x = "Abdulmajid"
// let y = 'Aman'
// let z = x + y
// console.log(z);
// Output is 'AbdulmajidAman'. This is because the two variables were added. If we want to add space around the words, we can add an empty single or double quotes and a space inside it which will translate to space between the two words
// let z = x + " " + y => 'Abdulmajid Aman'


// String interpolation have a special feature called multi line string where you can write the same way as using the newline escape character
// Example `some
// text ` Output: some\ntext
