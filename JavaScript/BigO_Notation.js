/* 
BigO notation => this is how the algorithm

time complexity => given an input array of n elements, the worst case scenario is that the alogorithm needs to make n number of iterations

               TYPES OF TIME COMPLEXITY
             ==============================
1. O(1) Constant => this is where you access a value in an object with its <keygen />
2. O(log n) logarithmic => Binary search. Accessing the middle elements
3. O(n)  Linear=> iteration through every element in an array 
4. O(n**2) Quadratic => nested iteration *
